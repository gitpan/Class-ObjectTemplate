Class::ObjectTemplate
---------------------

This package contains Perl extension for an optimized template builder
base class.

This module was first described in the O'Reilly book "Advanced Perl
Programming" by Sriram Srinivasan. 

Versions
--------

The original code from the book is available as version 0.1. Only
minor changes were made (mainly addition of Makefile.PL and
test.pl). There are some inheritance problems with this version.

Version 0.2 fixes the inheritance problems. Later versions add nicer
POD documentation.
