Class::ObjectTemplate
---------------------

This package contains Perl extension for an optimized template builder
base class.

This module was first described in the O'Reilly book "Advanced Perl
Programming" by Sriram Srinivasan. 

Versions
--------

The original code from the book is available as version 0.1. Only
minor changes were made (mainly addition of Makefile.PL and
test.pl). There are some inheritance problems with this version.

Version 0.2 fixes the inheritance problems. Later versions add nicer
POD documentation, and various code improvements.

Verifying the Release 
---------------------

The current maintainer, Jason E. Stewart (jason@openinformatics.com),
signs every release with his GnuPG public key. This is to help you
ensure that you are installing only officially sanctioned code, from
the official maintainer. By downloading the source code and signature
from one location (possibly open to attack) and the public key from an
official key server, you greatly reduce the chance of installing
software that is dangerous to you.

Getting the Public key 

You can use any keyserver you wish, such as www.keyserver.net, and
search for jason@openinformatics.com

Using PGP to verify the code

   1. Add the key to your keyring: pgpk -a key_file
   2. Verify the source code file pgpv <<Source-File>> <<Source-File>>.asc
   3. If you receive any other response than: Good signature,
      something went wrong, so don't trust the file. 


Using GnuPG to verify the code 

   1. Import the key to your keyring: gpg --import key_file
   2. Verify the source code file gpg --verify <<Source-File>>
      <<Source-File>>.asc 
   3. If you receive any other response than: gpg: Good signature,
      something went wrong, so don't trust the file.
